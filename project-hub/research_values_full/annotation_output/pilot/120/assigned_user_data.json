We focus on the following question: How to construct contrastive views for hypergraphs via augmentations? We provide the solutions in two folds. First, guided by domain knowledge, we fabricate two schemes to augment hyperedges with higher-order relations encoded, and adopt three vertex augmentation strategies from graph-structured data. Second, in search of more effective views in a data-driven manner, we for the first time propose a hypergraph generative model to generate augmented views, and then an end-to-end differentiable pipeline to jointly learn hypergraph augmentations and model parameters. Our technical innovations are reflected in designing both fabricated and generative augmentations of hypergraphs. The experimental findings include: (i) Among fabricated augmentations in HyperGCL, augmenting hyperedges provides the most numerical gains, implying that higher-order information in structures is usually more downstream-relevant; (ii) Generative augmentations do better in preserving higher-order information to further benefit generalizability; (iii) HyperGCL also boosts robustness and fairness in hypergraph representation learning.

It is unclear how TLS algorithms fare when provided with event corpora collected with varying IR methods. We therefore construct event-specific corpora from a large static background corpus, the newsroom dataset, using differing, relatively simple IR methods based on raw text alone. We show that the choice of IR method plays a crucial role in the performance of various TLS algorithms. A weak TLS algorithm can even match a stronger one by employing a stronger IR method in the data collection phase. Furthermore, the results of TLS systems are often highly sensitive to additional sentence filtering.

Many trust prediction methods are proposed based on the low-rank assumption of a trust network. However, one typical property of the trust network is that the trust relations follow the power-law distribution, i.e., few users are trusted by many other users, while most tail users have few trustors. Due to these tail users, the fundamental low-rank assumption made by existing methods is seriously violated and becomes unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to address the problem of the violated low-rank assumption. Instead of discovering the low-rank component of the trust network alone, we learn a sparse component of the trust network to describe the tail users simultaneously. With both of the learned low-rank and sparse components, the trust relations in the whole network can be better captured. Moreover, the transitive closure structure of the trust relations is also integrated into our model. We then derive an effective iterative algorithm to infer the parameters of our model, along with the proof of correctness.
